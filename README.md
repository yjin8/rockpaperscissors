# Rock Paper Scissors

## About
The simple, classic rock, paper scissors game coded using Python 3.6. This started as a technical exercise for a job I am applying for at Girls Who Code (fingers crossed). 

## How to Play
It's super easy! Just download the python file and run it through your choice of interpreter. Or, you can copy and paste the python code into an online interpreter such as http://repl.it and run it there. You should all know how to play from then on ;)

## What's Next?
There's always more to do! I want to add a more extensive menu with more than just a "do you want to play: Y/N". Hopefully, I'll be able to incorporate graphics in the near future!
